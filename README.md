# Lei's GitHub QA Portfolio :wave:

Welcome to my GitHub repository, created to showcase my skills and experience as an aspiring QA Engineer. This repo features a comprehensive collection of my work, highlighting my approach to QA, version control, CI/CD, automation, and beyond.

### My experience :office:
As a Java Backend Software Developer at Chinasoft International Ltd, I built solid software development foundations. I designed Restful APIs with Spring Boot, created unit tests using JUnit and automated deployments through Jenkins in CI/CD pipelines. This hands-on experience gave me deep insights into software quality standards and sparked my passion for QA. I have since actively improved my skills in my free time. I mastered Selenium for test automation, JIRA for defect management and advanced Postman features for API testing. With my IT support and service desk experience in solving complex system problems, this combination of development skills and self-led QA learning makes me eager to succeed in a QA role.

### Tech skills :computer:

* Rest API testing (proficient in using Postman for API testing and validation, with hands-on experience in building and maintaining Restful API architectures during backend development at Chinasoft International Ltd)
* Basic knowledge about software development models (waterfall, v model, iterative and incremental model, agile) – applied Agile methodologies in daily work at Chinasoft, including participating in CI/CD pipelines and collaborative development workflows
* Software testing – skilled in unit testing (using JUnit) and automated testing (integrated with Jenkins) as part of the development lifecycle at Chinasoft, with self-learned expertise in test automation frameworks like Selenium
* Creating test cases – developed targeted unit test cases for backend modules and API functionalities during ERP procurement system projects at Chinasoft International Ltd
* Reporting bugs – experienced in identifying and documenting software defects in previous roles, using platforms similar to JIRA; supplemented by self-learning JIRA for defect management
* Creating bug reports – understand the structure and key elements of bug reports through work experience, and have self-learned to draft clear, detailed bug reports with essential information to help development teams resolve issues efficiently
* Basic Python - for test automation (proficient in Python, with extensive practical application during Master of Data Science studies for data analysis; paired with hands-on use of test automation tools like Selenium)
* Basic HTML and CSS
* Creating documentation – self-learned to prepare clear technical documentation, including materials for API architectures and development processes based on backend project experiences
* Experience with testing SaaS web applications – familiar with testing logic and quality standards for web-based systems through software development and IT support roles
* Performing smoke tests – self-learned basic smoke testing practices and applied them to verify core functionalities of developed modules during backend work
* Testing UAT – self-learned user acceptance testing processes, and aligned test scenarios with business requirements from ERP procurement system projects at Chinasoft to support UAT activities
* Scrum workflow – adapted to Scrum practices in Agile teams at Chinasoft, collaborating on iterative development and addressing evolving project needs

## Bug Reporting 

In this section, I demonstrate my approach to bug reporting using GitHub’s issue tracking feature. You will find a detailed bug report template as well as examples of filled-out reports.

- [GitHub Issues Example](https://github.com/bennhub/GitHub-QA-Portfolio/issues/1).
- [Sample Bug Report](./Bug-Reporting/Sample-Bug-Report.md)
- [Bug Report Template](./Bug-Reporting/Template.md)
  

## Version Control

This section showcases my use of GitHub for version control, including the creation and management of branches, pull requests, and merges. You can explore the following:

- Branches and pull requests demonstrating a typical GitHub workflow.
- Documentation on how I approach version control.

## CI/CD Implementation

Here, I detail how I set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions. This section includes:

- [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/bennhub/GitHub-QA-Portfolio/actions) 
- [Documentation on my CI/CD setup](./CI-CD/CI-CD-Documentation.md)

## Automation Coding Project

This is a practical project where I apply automation to solve real-world problems. You can review the code, run the tests, and see the results.
