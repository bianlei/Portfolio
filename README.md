# Lei's GitHub QA Portfolio

### About me :wave:
Welcome to my GitHub repository, designed to demonstrate my skills and experience as a Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer. This repository contains a comprehensive collection of my work, showcasing my approach to QA, version control, CI/CD, automation, and more.

### My experience :office:
Being a junior software tester at Perfect Gym is my first professional position strictly in QA area. I have made a significant growth both in my tech and soft skills, such as strong analytical thinking and developped some know-how in test automation. In addition, in my previous job, one of my responsibilities was to oversee the correct operation of the internal system and report any bugs or defects to the administrators. I have grown very fond of this role, which has also made me interested in the QA path. My previous experience, although unrelated to the IT world, has allowed me to develop valuable soft skills in particular.

## Bug Reporting 

In this section, I demonstrate my approach to bug reporting using GitHub’s issue tracking feature. You will find a detailed bug report template as well as examples of filled-out reports.

- [GitHub Issues Example](https://github.com/bennhub/GitHub-QA-Portfolio/issues/1).
- [Sample Bug Report](./Bug-Reporting/Sample-Bug-Report.md)
- [Bug Report Template](./Bug-Reporting/Template.md)
  

## Version Control

This section showcases my use of GitHub for version control, including the creation and management of branches, pull requests, and merges. You can explore the following:

- Branches and pull requests demonstrating a typical GitHub workflow.
- Documentation on how I approach version control.

[View Version Control Details](./Version-Control/VC-Documentation.md)

## CI/CD Implementation

Here, I detail how I set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions. This section includes:

- [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/bennhub/GitHub-QA-Portfolio/actions) 
- [Documentation on my CI/CD setup](./CI-CD/CI-CD-Documentation.md)

## Automation Coding Project

This is a practical project where I apply automation to solve real-world problems. You can review the code, run the tests, and see the results.

 - [Automation Project](https://github.com/bennhub/GitHub-QA-Portfolio/tree/main/Automation-Project) 
 - [Automation Project README](./Automation-Project/Automation-Demo.md)

## Docker

This is a practical project where I utilize Docker to run Playwright scripts in a containerized environment. Docker ensures that the scripts run consistently across different environments, which is especially useful for automated browser testing.

 - [Docker README](./Docker/Playwright-Docker-Demo.md) 

## AI-QA 
**in progress..**
Check out my latest project using Google Gemini AI to assist in creating test cases. This showcases how I integrate advanced AI tools into the QA process.
