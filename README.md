## My experience 🌟
As a Java Backend Software Developer at Chinasoft International Ltd, I built solid software development foundations. I designed Restful APIs with Spring Boot, created unit tests using JUnit and automated deployments through Jenkins in CI/CD pipelines. This hands-on experience gave me deep insights into software quality standards and sparked my passion for QA. I have since actively improved my skills in my free time. I mastered Selenium for test automation, JIRA for defect management and advanced Postman features for API testing. With my IT support and service desk experience in solving complex system problems, this combination of development skills and self-led QA learning makes me eager to succeed in a QA role.

### Tech skills 🛠️

* Rest API testing (proficient in using Postman for API testing and validation, with hands-on experience in building and maintaining Restful API architectures during backend development at Chinasoft International Ltd)
* Basic knowledge about software development models (waterfall, v model, iterative and incremental model, agile) – applied Agile methodologies in daily work at Chinasoft, including participating in CI/CD pipelines and collaborative development workflows
* Software testing – skilled in unit testing (using JUnit) and automated testing (integrated with Jenkins) as part of the development lifecycle at Chinasoft, with self-learned expertise in test automation frameworks like Selenium
* Creating test cases – developed targeted unit test cases for backend modules and API functionalities during ERP procurement system projects at Chinasoft International Ltd
* Reporting bugs – experienced in identifying and documenting software defects in previous roles, using platforms similar to JIRA; supplemented by self-learning JIRA for defect management
* Creating bug reports – understand the structure and key elements of bug reports through work experience, and have self-learned to draft clear, detailed bug reports with essential information to help development teams resolve issues efficiently
* Basic Python - for test automation (proficient in Python, with extensive practical application during Master of Data Science studies for data analysis; paired with hands-on use of test automation tools like Selenium)
* Basic HTML and CSS
* Creating documentation – self-learned to prepare clear technical documentation, including materials for API architectures and development processes based on backend project experiences
* Experience with testing SaaS web applications – familiar with testing logic and quality standards for web-based systems through software development and IT support roles

## Bug Reporting 🪲

In this section, I demonstrate my approach to bug reporting using GitHub’s issue tracking feature. You will find a detailed bug report template as well as examples of filled-out reports.

- [Sample Bug Report](./Main/Bug-Reporting/Sample-Bug-Report.md)
- [Bug Report Template](./Main/Bug-Reporting/Bug-Report-Template.md)
  

## Version Control 🔁

This section outlines how I use Git (version control) to manage QA assets (e.g., test cases, automation scripts) in QA workflows. It includes practical branching strategies, pull request standards, and CI pipeline configurations tailored for QA work.
