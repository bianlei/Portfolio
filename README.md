## About My QA Background 🌟
As a former Java Backend Developer at Chinasoft International Ltd, I built a solid foundation in software development (Spring Boot APIs, JUnit unit tests, Jenkins CI/CD) — which gave me deep insights into **how to design tests that align with code quality standards**.

This experience sparked my passion for QA, and I’ve since upskilled in core QA tools:
- Selenium/Playwright for test automation
- Postman for API testing
- JIRA for defect management
- SQL (PostgreSQL) for data layer validation

My combination of **development expertise + self-led QA learning** lets me bridge the gap between dev and QA teams — a key strength for modern Agile environments.

## Core QA Skills 🛠️
I specialize in skills aligned with New Zealand’s tech industry standards:

### Testing Fundamentals
- Software testing models (Agile/Scrum, Waterfall) — applied Agile/Scrum in backend projects at Chinasoft
- Test types: Unit, Smoke, UAT, End-to-End (E2E) testing
- Test case design & documentation

### Automation & API Testing
- UI Automation: Selenium (Python), Playwright (TypeScript)
- API Testing: Postman, Rest Assured (Java)
- Test Frameworks: JUnit, Playwright Test

### Data & Database Skills
- SQL (PostgreSQL): Data validation, querying for test verification (SELECT, JOIN, aggregation functions)
- Data layer testing: Verify UI/API actions sync with database records

### Collaboration & DevOps
- Version Control: Git (branching, PRs for QA assets)
- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions (WIP)
- Defect Management: JIRA, structured bug reporting

## Test Automation Projects 💻
This section showcases practical automation projects (UI/API/database).

### UI/Web Automation
- [Selenium: Login Function Test](./Main/Automation-Project/selenium-login-test/README.md)
- [Playwright: E2E Shopping Flow Test (UI + PostgreSQL Validation)] (WIP) — *Demonstrates UI actions + PostgreSQL data consistency checks*
- [Playwright: Login Function Test] (WIP)

### API Automation
- [API: User Management Test (Registration + PostgreSQL Verification)] (WIP) — *API testing + database record validation*

### Database Validation (PostgreSQL)
- [PostgreSQL: Data Sync Test (UI/API → Database)] (WIP) — *Verify UI/API actions correctly update PostgreSQL tables (e.g., order/submission records)*

## Bug Reporting & Defect Management 🪲
Structured, actionable bug reports that help dev teams resolve issues efficiently.

- [Sample Bug Report](./Main/Bug-Reporting/Sample-Bug-Report.md)
- [Bug Report Template](./Main/Bug-Reporting/Bug-Report-Template.md)

## Version Control for QA 🔁
Manage QA assets (test scripts, cases) with Git — aligned with Agile team workflows.

- [Version Control Documentation (QA Asset Management)](./Main/Version-Control/VC-Documentation.md)

## CI/CD & Test Infrastructure 📝
Automate test execution and standardize environments.

- [GitHub Actions: Playwright Test Pipeline] (WIP) — *Auto-run Playwright tests + generate reports on code commit*
- [Docker: Test Environment Containerization] (WIP) — *One-click setup for consistent testing environments*
