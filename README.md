## Bug Reporting 

In this section, I demonstrate my approach to bug reporting using GitHub’s issue tracking feature. You will find a detailed bug report template as well as examples of filled-out reports.

- [Sample Bug Report](./Bug-Reporting/Sample-Bug-Report.md)
- [Bug Report Template](./Bug-Reporting/Template.md)
  

## Version Control

This section showcases my use of GitHub for version control, including the creation and management of branches, pull requests, and merges. You can explore the following:

- Branches and pull requests demonstrating a typical GitHub workflow.
- Documentation on how I approach version control.

## CI/CD Implementation

Here, I detail how I set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions. This section includes:

- [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/bennhub/GitHub-QA-Portfolio/actions) 
- [Documentation on my CI/CD setup](./CI-CD/CI-CD-Documentation.md)

## Automation Coding Project

This is a practical project where I apply automation to solve real-world problems. You can review the code, run the tests, and see the results.

 - [Automation Project README](./Automation-Project/Automation-Demo.md)

## Docker

This is a practical project where I utilize Docker to run Playwright scripts in a containerized environment. Docker ensures that the scripts run consistently across different environments, which is especially useful for automated browser testing.
